A note on naming: 

models are named according to the number of samples in the training set, so for example:

lifespan_12K_57sites_train means the training sample consisting of 12000 subjectes from 57 sites

mqc: manual qc

mqc2: a subset of the mqc sample matched to the training data from the big dataset (i.e. which allows a fair comparison between the models)
